This repository contains practical materials for the "Parallel Programming" topic in the course of "MSB1015 - Scientific Programming" 

**The practical is made available in two programming languages: R and Python**

You can either fork the repository if you have git installed, or download it from "<> Code" and then "Download ZIP".

In the downloaded/forked folder, there are two options:
- **For R users:**
  - R is required to be installed (the practical script is tested with R v4)
  - RStudio is prefered to run the each part of the script alone and examine the results.
  - Use MSB1015-Practical.R (instructions included in the script file)
- **For Python users:**
  - Python >= 3.8 and Jupyter Notebook are required to run the practical notebook.
  - Use MSB1015-Practical.ipynb (instructions included in the notebook file)
